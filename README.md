any Browser extensions i happen to make

Ultimate extension so far has three things, it adds a speed change button to youtube shorts(Does not work great yet). Removes the twitch streams at the top of the page(Can turn on or off). and adds a scrollbar to the youtube side videos so you can scroll through new ones while keeping the main video in view(Can turn on or off)
